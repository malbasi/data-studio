# Pitch

## Summary

Whopayswriters.com collects crowd-sourced information about payments to freelance journalists. The website contains information for about 1200 publications dating back as far as 2012. Each data point records the publication, amount paid per word or per piece, length of the piece and amount of time it took to get paid. As newsrooms continue to shrink and rampant layoffs plague the industry more and more journalists are forced in to freelance work. How well will they get paid in these new positions? How does that compare to an average staff salary? And where are the best places to pitch?

We have to assume this data set only offers an incomplete picture of freelancers wages.

The data extracted from the website has been cleaned, but could still go through the wash a few more times. The most basic information needed for analysis, the pay rate and publication name, are
